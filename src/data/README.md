# Data

Some of the files in this directory are auto-generated and should not be modified manually.

## baseline-data.js (autogenerated)

Contains the aggregated data for [baseline](https://web.dev/baseline).

To generate baseline data, run:

```shell
npm run build:baseline
```

This implementation is based on the following source from @eslint/css:
[eslint/css/src/data/README.md](https://github.com/eslint/css/blob/css-v0.4.0/src/data/README.md)
